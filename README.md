# locale (legacy repository)

This is the legacy translation repository for LuckPerms for version `< 5.2`.

For version `>= 5.2`, translations are now managed on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/luckperms).

This fork will attempt to move the translation on Crowdin into here so it can be used for server still using version `< 5.2`.

# How to install

1. download the locale file you want to use.
2. rename it to `lang.yml`.
3. put it onto `\LuckPerms` folder.
